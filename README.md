The Odin Project Foundations Course: Landing Page 
Will combine what HTML and CSS I have absorbed so far in the course to create a landing page. In tandem with the construction I am to use good practice in logging changes to Github repo. I do not intend to use Commit Messages exhaustively during this project, since I anticipate a lot of experimentation to take place. THat said, when I think I have made a meaningful change to the best of my judgement I will use the commit message to designate it.
